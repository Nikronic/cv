## FAQs
1. *Q: What is the "updated: [DATE]" at the bottom of each page?* A: It represents the last time the *content* of the file has been changed *significantly*.
For instance, fixing grammar, adding new links or even formatting is not counted toward major changes.
2. *Q: Underlines?* A: All texts with underlines contain links to their corresponding web pages. For github cases, full link is also available in text since most of my work is hosted there.
